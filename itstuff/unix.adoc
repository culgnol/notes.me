Solution 2: use the root account directly
Don't use sudo, just switch to root to run your commands. Run one of the following commands to do so:
```
$ sudo -i
$ su 
Once you are logged in as root, just run your apt-get commands again:
# apt-get ...
You might have to set root's PATH first though. Edit /root/.bashrc (with root privileges of course), and add the following line:
export PATH=/usr/local/sbin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/sbin:/usr/bin:/sbin:/bin
```
