=== Files

# Echo the contents of a file
f = open('foo.txt', 'rU')
for line in f:   ## iterates over the lines of the file
print line,    ## trailing , so print does not add an end-of-line char
               ## since 'line' already includes the end-of line.
f.close()

Performance tip:
	• Reading one line at a time like example above, not all the file needs to fit in memory at one time
	• "f.readlines()" reads the whole file into memory, returning contents as a list of lines
	• "f.read()" reads the whole file into a single string, and searched with regular expressions

Use "f.write(string)" for writing to file (optionally in Python 3.x, print(string, file=f))
