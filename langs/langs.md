# Languages

Quick reference for programming languages

Currently Github doesn't support the `include` directive of AsciiDoc:

* https://github.com/github/markup/issues/1095

For now, go to the [fragments](fragments/) directory. Once resolved the following asciidoc's will properly render (or view locally):

* [All Snippets](templates/fragments.adoc)
* [Javascript](templates/javascript.adoc)
