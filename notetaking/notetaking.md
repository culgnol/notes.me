# Notetaking

Github [supports](https://github.com/github/markup#markups) several markdown languages. Examples of ones I played around with so far:

## [Markdown](markdown.adoc)
<<markdown.adoc#,Markdown>>

Most basic of the bunch.

## [AsciiDoc](asciidoc.adoc)
<<asciidoc.adoc#,AsciiDoc>>

Most notable feature I like:

- Adding callouts to source code highlights
- Adding bibilography / references
- You can add a TOC!!!
- Additional you can be parsed to generate HTML5, PDF, etc content

Example of what it looks like [previewed](https://gist.github.com/dcode/) in Github
