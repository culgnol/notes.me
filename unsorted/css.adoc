== Where can I place them? Which has higher precedence?

* Inline Styles > Internal Styles > External Styles

Q: Why Inline Styles have higher precedence? A: Because everthing in the HTML is read top-down, as well as in CSS hence "Cascading"


Best practice:

* use External Styles for ease of organization and maintenance
* when applicable always list all External Styles first, then the Internal Styles (as they maybe specific to the page)

                background-color: black;
                color: white;
            }
        </style>
